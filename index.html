			<h2>UNIVERSITY OF APPLIED SCIENCES</h2>

			<p>The University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna <a href="https://www.fh-campuswien.ac.at/" target="blank">(FH Campus Vienna)</a> is the largest university of applied sciences in Austria.

			<p>My department is the technique department. I am currently a computer science and digital communications student. I still have to go a long way to master html and css, but hope with the course of one month to reach my goal someday.
